a handful of alternative executables are included for convenience's sake.

to use the script, set it as executable and run it in the folder with your audio files. it will create a folder called "m4a" and store the converted files there. once the entire operation is complete, a file called "conversion complete" will be created. "conversion complete" and "convert.sh" can be safely deleted.
